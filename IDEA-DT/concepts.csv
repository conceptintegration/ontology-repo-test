1,Absence of Corruption,Absence of Corruption measures the degree to which public officials (including elected representatives and public servants) abuse their positions through the arbitrary exercise of power for illicit personal or political gain. It also includes lax or selective enforcement of relevant laws intended to prevent significant acts of corruption in the private sector.
2,Access to Justice,"Access to Justice measures the extent to which individuals and groups can use legal institutions to redress injustices and wrongful acts, including historic wrongs. It also entails a guarantee that all people are equal before courts and tribunals and those accused of a crime have an effective right to a fair trial. That is, that people have equal access to the justice system without discrimination and are also guaranteed due process (free from corruption), including when they are accused and charged with a crime. Access to Justice may also take the form of non-judicial (or quasi-judicial) mechanisms for traditional dispute resolution, transitional justice, and truth and reconciliation processes (Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights n.d.b)."
3,Basic Welfare,"Basic Welfare measures the extent to which a populations basic needs, including access to essential goods and services such as nutrition, healthcare and education, are met."
4,Civic Engagement,"Civic Engagement primarily encompasses membership in voluntary, non-party, formal associations (Theiss-Morse and Hibbing 2005), but may also include individual participation in collective political activities."
5,Civil Liberties,"Civil liberties are those negative rights that are understood to be most closely linked to political activity or personal fulfilment. Some theorists see these rights as being inherent to human personhood (Foster 2008: 3). Civil liberties set boundaries for state conduct, specifying the areas where a citizens freedom of action, conduct, or condition should be legally protected (Katalin 1991) and which can only be limited by the government when their completely free exercise would conflict with other goals of democratic government (Hovius 1986; Gardbaum 2007). Note that civil liberties are generally understood to apply to individuals and not to groups. The list of rights that are included within the concept of civil liberties is not universally agreed upon. However, the most common rights to be included are the freedoms of expression, association, assembly and religion, along with rights to life, property, privacy, bodily integrity and a fair trial. Civil liberties differ from civil rights (at least in contemporary English-language discourse) in that civil rights primarily concern guarantees against discrimination (Schmidt 2016: 1). Some aspects of civil rights are included under Social Group Equality."
6,Civil Society,"One of the leading scholars of this concept defined it this way: The words civil society name the space of uncoerced human association and also the set of relational networksformed for the sake of family, faith, interest and ideologythat fill this space (Walzer 1995). For the purposes of the GSoD framework, the most important elements of this definition are the space and the networks. We also consider the interactions between these uncoerced associations and the state to be part of this network."
7,Credible Elections,"Credible Elections is a measure of the extent to which electoral processes are free and fair. Our conception is based on the electoral cycle approach, which emphasizes the importance of the cyclical nature of elections and the ways in which the pre-election, election day and post-election periods are interlinked and impact each other. Based on this approach, our measure of Credible Elections may be impacted by a range of activities and events, including, for example, changes to the electoral law, the process of observer accreditation, candidate registration, polling station irregularities, election authorities independence and post-election audits."
8,Economic Equality,"Economic Equality is a measure of the extent to which individuals and social groups enjoy equal socio-economic rights and ability to exert political influence. Events coded as affecting Economic Equality may overlap with Social Group Equality, but this measure is related to changes in a countrys economy that primarily affect the relative economic position of individuals or social groups."
9,Effective Parliament,"Effective Parliament describes the extent to which the legislature fulfils the core democratic functions of a legislature. The core democratic functions of a legislature are: (1) to represent the people, (2) to make laws and (3) to provide oversight and accountability to other branches of the government (B�ckenf�rde 2011). Some scholars add a fourth function: to provide constituency service through which the members of the legislature assist the people whom they represent in accessing government services (Barkan 2017). This may also be considered to be a particular form of representation (function 1)."
10,Elected Government,"Elected Government measures the extent to which key positions within the executive branch of government are selected through competitive multiparty elections. As members of the executive in parliamentary systems are drawn from the legislature, the extent to which the legislature is selected through competitive multiparty elections is also relevant."
11,Electoral Participation,Electoral Participation measures the rate at which members of the political community participate in electoral processes.
12,Free Political Parties,"Free Political Parties assess the restraints and barriers preventing citizens from organizing themselves into political parties or their equivalents and how free those political parties are to contest elections and compete with similar organizations and parties. It also includes the extent to which elected political parties in a countrys legislature are able to exercise the powers of that office, or whether their ability to participate is limited by unconstitutional or otherwise broadly undemocratic means."
13,Freedom of Assembly and Association,"Freedom of Association concerns the ability of individuals to formally join together in groups to pursue common interests (Joseph and Castan 2013). Such groups include trade unions, political parties, NGOs, professional or sporting clubs and corporations (Joseph and Castan 2013). Freedom of Assembly concerns the extent to which individuals are able to participate in peaceful gatherings of more than one person, which may be in-person or online, in public or in private. It covers a range of different types of gathering, including meetings, processions, protests, demonstrations, rallies, strikes and sit-ins (United Nations Human Rights Committee 2020; Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights n.d.a)."
14,Freedom of Expression,"Freedom of expression is a measure of the ability of individuals both to express themselves and to hear from others on private and public matters, free from censorship and without fear of retribution or outsized legal or social consequences."
15,Freedom of Movement,"Freedom of Movement is a measure of the ability of individuals to reside and move freely within a country or between countries, including the ability to leave and return to a country, for purposes of leisure, employment, emigration and asylum-seeking, without undue impediments or fear of repercussions from governments. The extent to which this right can be infringed upon is subject to national laws, issues of national security, public order and health (United Nations 1966a)."
16,Freedom of Religion,"Freedom of Religion entails the right to express or practise ones religion or faith, both publicly and privately, and individually or collectively (United Nations 1966a: article 18). It also encompasses the freedom not to practise any religion at all and to be free from the imposition of religion. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has further asserted that freedom of religion includes the right of a person to change or leave their religion, establish a new religious group (United Nations Human Rights Committee 1993), or to be non-religious. The rights of religious minorities should be equally protected (including, for example, in access to education or healthcare) and their members not discriminated against. Freedom of religion may only be subject to restrictions established in law that are necessary for public order, safety or health (United Nations 1966a: article 18)."
17,Freedom of the Press,"Freedom of the Press refers to the right of media organizations and individuals to report, publish and distribute information and opinions without governmental censorship, interference or fear of retribution. It rests on three key principles: (1) independence, allowing journalists and media outlets to operate free from undue political or corporate influence; (2) protection, ensuring journalists are safeguarded from physical harm, intimidation and unjust prosecution; and (3) transparency, promoting access to accurate information and enabling the press to scrutinize institutions, thereby fostering accountability and public discourse."
18,Gender Equality,"Gender equality refers to the equal enjoyment of rights, responsibilities and opportunities for people of any gender expression. It requires that the interests, needs and priorities of all genders in their diversity are considered (UN Women 2022). The concept is understood based on diverse perspectives of feminists and gender theorists, who have found the roots of gender inequality in social constructs rather than biological differences, critiqued gender norms which have focused on masculine ideals and challenged gender as a binary conception or an inherent identity (Beauvoir 2011; Irigaray 1977; Butler 1990). Gender equality calls for greater opportunities for women in the workforce and public life, and the need to apply an intersectional lens to analysis, recognizing that factors such as race and class shape (and are shaped by) gender inequality. The concept also addresses the ability of traditionally marginalized genders to make substantial improvements to their lives, going beyond representation and access to resources."
19,Inclusive Suffrage,"A democratic government must be representative of the people it represents, and it follows that any such government requires ensuring every member of the political community has a vote of equal weight.... However, existing states may choose to extend the franchise to non-citizens living within or without its boundaries, change the voting age, or extend/restrict the franchise to diaspora communities.... A state may also make technical or legal changes that limit or expand the practical ability of enfranchised adults to cast a vote (such as changing the distribution or voting stations or registration procedures), or it could permit a private actor, political party, or any similar such entity to act in such a way that the same effect is observed."
20,Judicial Independence,"Judicial Independence entails the justice system functioning free from influence from both government and non-state actors. Basic requisites for a judicial system that is independent and impartial are laid out in international standards and doctrine, and comprise aspects such as: the duty of government and other institutions to refrain from direct or indirect pressures, interferences or threats to the judicial process; the ability of courts to assert their competence and jurisdiction; the prohibition of special courts; the establishment of objective factors (such as appropriate qualifications and experience) for appointments and promotions; security of tenure, salary and conditions of service; and adequate provisions for disciplinary measures and their independent review (United Nations 1985)."
21,Local Democracy,"Local Democracy is the ability of subnational governments to conduct fair and credible elections, and the extent to which they are selected through them, as well as the degree to which they competently exercise the vested powers and responsibilities inherent in their offices. The GSoD Indices use a strict definition of local, that is municipal, government but the Democracy Tracker is slightly broader and considers higher-level subnational forms as well."
22,Personal Integrity and Security,"Personal Integrity and Security is a measure of the extent to which individuals physical person, personal autonomy, and personal information are free from unwarranted harm or interference from the state or other actors. Personal Integrity and Security can be harmed in many ways, including through actions that kill, maim or injure people; deprive people of their freedom without due process; limit peoples bodily autonomy; or expose information about people without their consent."
23,Political Equality,"[A]ll adult members of the political community should have an equal right to have their voices heard, and be given equal consideration in the formulation of public policy (Beetham 2009: 282). Following this definition, any reduction in an individuals voice and influence due to an ascriptive characteristic or non-political personal choice (such as place of residence or occupation) is detrimental to the overall level of political equality, and thus to the fundamental extent of democracy in the polity. As the concept of Political Equality is so broad, we measure it with reference to three subfactors: Social Group Equality, Economic Equality and Gender Equality."
24,Predictable Enforcement,"Predictable Enforcement refers to the consistent, transparent and impartial application and enforcement of laws by public servants, including bureaucrats, law enforcement agencies and the judiciary. It rests on three key principles: (1) transparency, with laws that are clear, accessible, and publicly communicated, (2) consistency, with laws uniformly applied and interpreted across different cases and individuals, and (3) impartiality, with equal enforcement of laws, regardless of an individual or entitys status or position."
25,Social Group Equality,"Social Group Equality measures the extent to which members of all social groups can enjoy the same degree of civil liberties, political power and opportunities. It also measures whether a particular group (or groups) has a more favourable position in comparison with others in the enjoyment of these rights, and conversely, if a particular group (or groups) faces repression, discrimination or persecution. Regarding the treatment of non-citizens, Social Group Equality relates to the extent to which the rule of law is ensured consistently and without discrimination, and laws and practices are applied in compliance with States international obligations."
