# üè¶ Ontology repository

This repository hosts the ontologies available on the [Sartori]() website.

## Submit your own ontology

We accept new ontologies! To be included, you need to prepare a .csv file in which each row is a concept/topic. 
See an [example .csv file]().

Required columns:

- `key`: a unique key for the concept

- `label`: a short label for the concept

- `description`: a longer description for the concept

Other accepted columns:

- `example`: a segment that exemplifies the concept

- `parent_key`: for hierarchical ontologies, the parent key of the concept

- `notes`: any note relevant to the concept (128-character limit)

- `keywords`: concepts that are highly related, perhaps as hyponymns, hypernymns, or otherwise related.
